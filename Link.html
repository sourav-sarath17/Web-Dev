    <p style="font-size: large">
      JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
      language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of
      websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10] Web
      browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
      These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The
      most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js. JavaScript
      is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
      ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
      supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It
      has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
      dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
      Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not include any
      input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
      In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript
      APIs for I/O. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax,
      and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and
      differ greatly in design. History Creation at Netscape The first popular
      web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993.
      Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the
      rapid growth of the early World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of
      Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more
      polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the
      most-used.[13] During these formative years of the Web, web pages could
      only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page
      was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web
      development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided
      to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to
      achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java
      language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]
      The goal was a "language for the masses",[14] "to help nonprogrammers
      create dynamic, interactive Web sites".[15] Netscape management soon
      decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with
      syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting
      languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter
      implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a
      Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for
      the official release in December.[6][1][16][17] The choice of the
      JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related
      to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular
      new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by
      Netscape.[14] Adoption by Microsoft Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in
      1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front,
      Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript.[18] Microsoft first
      released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions
      to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their
      counterparts in Netscape Navigator.[19][20] These differences made it
      difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both
      browsers, leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best
      viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.[19][21] The rise of
      JScript Brendan Eich later said of this period: "It's still kind of a
      sidekick language. It's considered slow or annoying. People do pop-ups or
      those scrolling messages in the old status bar at the bottom of your old
      browser."[14] In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma
      International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all
      browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the
      first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997. The standards
      process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in
      June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in
      2000.[18] However, the effort to fully standardize the language was
      undermined by Microsoft gaining an increasingly dominant position in the
      browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share
      reached 95%.[22] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for
      client-side scripting on the Web. Microsoft initially participated in the
      standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language,
      but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4
      was mothballed.

      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>
        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design
        philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant
        indentation.[32] Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It
        supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
        (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
        It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
        comprehensive standard library.[33][34] Guido van Rossum began working
        on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming
        language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0
        was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision
        not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18,
        released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[36] Python
        consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and
        has gained widespread use in the machine learning
        community.[37][38][39][40] History Main article: History of Python The
        designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006 Python was invented
        in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde &
        Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC
        programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of
        exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12]
        Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered
        sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12
        July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his
        responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a
        title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term
        commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he has since come
        out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019,
        active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to
        lead the project.[45][46] Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000,
        with many major new features such as list comprehensions,
        cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode
        support.[47] Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, with many of
        its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of
        Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of
        Python 2 code to Python 3.[49] Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially
        set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of
        existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No
        further security patches or other improvements will be released for
        it.[52][53] Currently only 3.9 and later are supported (2023 security
        issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While
        Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial
        Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e.
        "2.7.18+" (plus 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) "backported
        security updates".[55] In 2021 (and again twice in 2022, and in
        September 2024 for Python 3.12.6 down to 3.8.20), security updates were
        expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56])
        because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57]
        and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were
        expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When
        Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9
        series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive
        security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases
        were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14,
        3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63] Every Python release since 3.5 has added
        some syntax to the language. 3.10 added the | union type operator[64]
        and the match and case keywords (for structural pattern matching
        statements). 3.11 expanded exception handling functionality. Python 3.12
        added the new keyword type. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include
        increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[65]
        Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and
        Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error
        messages, and many other changes. Python 3.13 introduces more syntax for
        types, a new and improved interactive interpreter (REPL), featuring
        multi-line editing and color support; an incremental garbage collector
        (producing shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of
        objects, and addition to the improved speed in 3.11 and 3.12), and an
        experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler (such features, can/needs to be
        enabled specifically for the increase in speed),[66] and an experimental
        free-threaded build mode, which disables the global interpreter lock
        (GIL), allowing threads to run more concurrently, that latter feature
        enabled with python3.13t or python3.13t.exe. Python 3.13 introduces some
        change in behavior, i.e. new "well-defined semantics", fixing bugs (plus
        many removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods, and removed
        some of the C API and outdated modules): "The [old] implementation of
        locals() and frame.f_locals is slow, inconsistent and buggy [and it has]
        has many corner cases and oddities. Code that works around those may
        need to be changed. Code that uses locals() for simple templating, or
        print debugging, will continue to work correctly."[67] Since 7 October
        2024, Python 3.13 is the latest stable release, and 3.13 and 3.12 are
        the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support and
        Python 3.9 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the
        'security support' phase), due to Python 3.8 reaching end-of-life.[68]
        Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support
        (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for
        same total support as before). Some (more) standard library modules and
        many deprecated classes, functions and methods, will be removed in
        Python 3.15 or 3.16.[69][70] Python 3.14 (now in alpha 1)[71] has
        changes for annotations, with PEP 649 "[preserving] nearly all existing
        behavior of annotations from stock semantics".[72] Design philosophy and
        features Python is a multi-paradigm programming language.
        Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully
        supported, and many of their features support functional programming and
        aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[73] and
        metaobjects).[74] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions,
        including design by contract[75][76] and logic programming.[77] Python
        is known as a glue language,[78] able to work very well with many other
        languages with ease of access. Python uses dynamic typing and a
        combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage
        collector for memory management.[79] It uses dynamic name resolution
        (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program
        execution. Its design offers some support for functional programming in
        the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list
        comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[80] The
        standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that
        implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[81]
        Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which
        includes aphorisms such as:[82] Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit
        is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is
        better than complicated. Readability counts. However, Python features
        regularly violate these principles and have received criticism for
        adding unnecessary language bloat.[83] Responses to these criticisms are
        that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule.[84] The
        addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van
        Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over
        the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python
        3.8.[85][86] Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality
        into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules.
        This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of
        adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's
        vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily
        extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which
        espoused the opposite approach.[41] Python claims to strive for a
        simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a
        choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is more
        than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one—and
        preferably only one—obvious way to do it." philosophy.[82] In practice,
        however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are,
        for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no
        certainty as to which one a programmer should use.[87] Alex Martelli, a
        Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote:
        "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the
        Python culture."[88] Python's developers usually strive to avoid
        premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the
        CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in
        speed at the cost of clarity.[89] Execution speed can be improved by
        moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in
        languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It
        is also possible to cross-compile to other languages, but it either
        doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python
        is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is
        compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.[90] Python's
        developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a
        tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[91]—and in occasionally
        playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use
        of the terms "spam" and "eggs" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in
        examples, instead of the often-used "foo" and "bar".[92][93] A common
        neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of
        meanings related to program style. "Pythonic" code may use Python idioms
        well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with
        Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is
        difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another
        programming language is called unpythonic.[94]

      <h2>Java</h2>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: large">
      Java is a set of computer software and specifications that provides a
      software platform for developing application software and deploying it in
      a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of
      computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise
      servers and supercomputers. Java applets, which are less common than
      standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure, sandboxed
      environments to provide many features of native applications through being
      embedded in HTML pages. Writing in the Java programming language is the
      primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java
      virtual machine (JVM); byte code compilers are also available for other
      languages, including Ada, JavaScript, Kotlin (Google's preferred Android
      language), Python, and Ruby. In addition, several languages have been
      designed to run natively on the JVM, including Clojure, Groovy, and Scala.
      Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++, but object-oriented features
      are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C.[13] Java eschews certain
      low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model
      where objects are allocated on the heap (while some implementations e.g.
      all currently supported by Oracle, may use escape analysis optimization to
      allocate on the stack instead) and all variables of object types are
      references. Memory management is handled through integrated automatic
      garbage collection performed by the JVM. Latest version The latest version
      is Java 22 released in March 2024, and the latest long-term support (LTS)
      version is Java 21 released in September 2023, which is one of a few LTS
      versions still supported, down to Java 8 LTS. As an open source platform,
      Java has many distributors, including Amazon, IBM, Azul Systems, and
      AdoptOpenJDK. Distributions include Amazon Corretto, Zulu, AdoptOpenJDK,
      and Liberica. Regarding Oracle, it distributes Java 8, and also makes
      available e.g. Java 11, both also currently supported LTS versions. Oracle
      (and others) "highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java"
      than Java 8,[14] because of serious risks due to unresolved security
      issues.[15][16][17] Since Java 9 (as well as versions 10, and 12–16, and
      18–20) are no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to "immediately
      transition" to a supported version. Oracle released the last
      free-for-commercial-use public update for the legacy Java 8 LTS in January
      2019, and will continue to support Java 8 with public updates for personal
      use indefinitely. Oracle extended support for Java 6 ended in December
      2018.[18] Platform The Java platform is a suite of programs that
      facilitate developing and running programs written in the Java programming
      language. A Java platform includes an execution engine (called a virtual
      machine), a compiler and a set of libraries; there may also be additional
      servers and alternative libraries that depend on the requirements. Java
      platforms have been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and
      operating systems with a view to enable Java programs to run identically
      on all of them. The Java platform consists of several programs, each of
      which provides a portion of its overall capabilities. For example, the
      Java compiler, which converts Java source code into Java bytecode (an
      intermediate language for the JVM), is provided as part of the Java
      Development Kit (JDK). The Java Runtime Environment (JRE), complementing
      the JVM with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, converts intermediate bytecode
      into native machine code on the fly. The Java platform also includes an
      extensive set of libraries. The essential components in the platform are
      the Java language compiler, the libraries, and the runtime environment in
      which Java intermediate bytecode executes according to the rules laid out
      in the virtual machine specification. Application domains Different
      platforms target different classes of device and application domains: Java
      Card: A technology that allows small Java-based applications (applets) to
      be run securely on smart cards and similar small-memory devices. Java ME
      (Micro Edition): Specifies several different sets of libraries (known as
      profiles) for devices with limited storage, display, and power capacities.
      It is often used to develop applications for mobile devices, PDAs, TV
      set-top boxes, and printers. Java SE (Standard Edition): For
      general-purpose use on desktop PCs, servers and similar devices. Jakarta
      EE (Enterprise Edition): Java SE plus various APIs which are useful for
      multi-tier client–server enterprise applications. Java SE These paragraphs
      are an excerpt from Java Platform, Standard Edition.[edit] Java Platform,
      Standard Edition (Java SE) is a computing platform for development and
      deployment of portable code for desktop and server environments.[19] Java
      SE was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE). The
      platform uses the Java programming language and is part of the Java
      software-platform family. Java SE defines a range of general-purpose
      APIs—such as Java APIs for the Java Class Library—and also includes the
      Java Language Specification and the Java Virtual Machine
      Specification.[20] OpenJDK is the official reference implementation since
      version 7.[21][22][23] Jakarta EE This paragraph is an excerpt from
      Jakarta EE.[edit] Jakarta EE, formerly Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
      (Java EE) and Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), is a set of
      specifications, extending Java SE[24] with specifications for enterprise
      features such as distributed computing and web services.[25] Jakarta EE
      applications are run on reference runtimes, which can be microservices or
      application servers, which handle transactions, security, scalability,
      concurrency and management of the components they are deploying.
